The Hugo theme is a combination of [Lei Yang](leiy.me)'s acaminimal (with adjustments by [Xinyue Lin](https://xinyue-lin.com/)) and [https://heyarviind.com](https://heyarviind.com) hugo-uilite
with styling from [Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham](https://paulgp.github.io/). I found [Mike Dane's](https://www.mikedane.com/) introduction to Hugo videos useful for understanding how hugo works.


## How to Edit Each Section

### Sidebar

Sidebar is controlled by the file `config.toml`.

- `title` is the title of the website.
- `shortbio` is the text displayed right under the title.
- `logo` is the filename of the picture. The file is placed in `static/images/`. For example, if `logo = "images/gr.jpg"` then the picture should be placed at `static/images/gr.jpg` (as it is now).

### Research and teaching

These sections are controlled and automatically generated by "data files" placed under `data/` directory. Data files will be combined, so you may group entries by year, book, affiliation, etc. and place them in individual data files. **The order they appear on the website is determined by the order of the files in the directory.**

#### Syntax of Data Files: Research

All data files follow a similar format: Notice that the first entry is the
paper type.

```yaml
working_papers:
- title: "The title of the article"
  pdflink: "http://example.com/link-to-the.pdf"
  book: "Where and when does the article appear"
  note: "A short note displayed under the title"
  coauthors: "Coauthor A, Coauthor B and Coauthor C"
  links:
    - url: "http://example.com/external-link-1"
      text: "Text of the link"
      note: "A short description of the link"
    - url: "http://example.com/external-link-2"
      text: "Text of the link"
      note: "An unlimited number of links are supported!"
  abstract: >
    Abstract of the article. Don't forget the ">" above.

- title: "The second article"
  note: "The same syntax as the first article"
```

Everything in the data files are optional, except the title. So you may have an article without abstract and links, and another one without note and PDF link.

#### Syntax of Data Files: Teaching

```yaml
- title: "Class name"
  id: "Class number"
  institute: "institution"
  term: "timing -- be consistent! e.g. Semester 'XX"
  instructor: "Prof / instructor"
  role: "Your role"
```


### Adding a section

**To add a section with content you generate by hand.**

0. Pick your new sections name.
1. Create a new content directory with the chosen name and add a file called `_index.md`
2. Create a new layout directory with the same name and add a file called `section.html`

  ```html
  {{ define "main" -}}
  {{ .Content }}
  {{- end}}
  ```

  The content in `_index.md` will be converted to html. This will be accessible at
  "<your_url>/<new_section_name>/" and a link will appear in
  the site's sidebar.

**To add a section with content generated by hugo.**

Follow the steps 1 and 2 from above.

3. Create a new data directory with the same name and add a yaml file (pick any name, e.g. `list.yaml`).

Now you'll need to consider the data structure. What information will be common across information listed in this section?
In the yaml file create some data.

4. Create a format for each item and place it in `section.html`

```html
{{ define "main" -}}
{{ .Content }}

<!-- loop over new information here -->
{{ range .Site.Data.<new_section_name> }}
<!-- see e.g. /teaching/section.html -->
{{ end }}

{{- end}}
```
